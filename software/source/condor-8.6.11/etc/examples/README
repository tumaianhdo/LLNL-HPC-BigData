This directory contains various default Condor files for your use.
The appropriate files are copied out of this directory and configured
automatically by the condor_configure script.  If you choose not to
use condor_configure (or don't have perl) you will have to do the
customization manually.

Some files here are default config files for various Condor
configurations.  They have "config" in their name.  If you are
installing manually, select the appropriate version, copy it to your
desired location, and edit it to customize Condor for your site.

A perl script wrapper is included that is for use with submit-only
installations.  

If your system uses SysV-style init scripts, there is also a default
condor script that can be installed in /etc/init.d (or wherever the
boot scripts go on your platform) to use for starting and stopping
Condor on your machine.

Please read the INSTALL file or the Installation section of the Condor
Administrator's Manual for details on installing Condor.
