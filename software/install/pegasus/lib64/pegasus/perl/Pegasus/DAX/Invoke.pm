=head1 NAME

Pegasus::DAX::Invoke - class to collect data for callback invocations.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Pegasus::DAX::Invoke qw(:all);

    my $i = Pegasus::DAX::Invoke->new( INVOKE_AT_END, '....' );
    print "when is ", $i->when, "\n";
    $i->cmd = '/bin/mailx -s foo a@b.c'
    print "command is '", $i->cmd, "'\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class remembers a callback invocation. The callback is a command
passed to the shell to be executed on the user's behalf whenever a job
passes a certain event. The event states are available as C<INVOKE_*>
constants.

=head1 CONSTANTS

=over 4

=item INVOKE_NEVER

Never run the invoke. This is primarily to temporarily disable an invoke.

=item INVOKE_START

Run the invoke when the job gets submitted.

=item INVOKE_ON_SUCCESS

Run the invoke after the job finishes with success (exitcode == 0).

=item INVOKE_ON_ERROR

Run the invoke after the job finishes with failure (exitcode != 0).

=item INVOKE_AT_END

Run the invoke after the job finishes, regardless of exit code.

=item INVOKE_ALL

Like C<INVOKE_START> and C<INVOKE_AT_END> combined.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item new( $when, $cmd )

The construct must be called with two arguments. The first argument
is a string, according to the C<INVOKE_*> constants. The second
argument is the complete command-line to be executed on the user's
behalf.

=item when()

This is the getter for the event specification.

=item when( C<INVOKE_*> )

This is the setter for the event specification.

=item cmd()

This is the getter for the command-line string.

=item cmd( $cmd )

This is the setter for the complete command-line string.

=item toXML( $handle, $indent, $xmlns )

The purpose of the C<toXML> function is to recursively generate XML from
the internal data structures. The first argument is a file handle open
for writing. This is where the XML will be generated.  The second
argument is a string with the amount of white-space that should be used
to indent elements for pretty printing. The third argument may not be
defined. If defined, all element tags will be prefixed with this name
space.

=head1 SEE ALSO

=over 4

=item L<Pegasus::DAX::Base>

Base class.

=item L<Pegasus::DAX::AbstractJob>

The abstract job class aggregates instances of this class to be
called when the proper event is triggered.

=item L<Pegasus::DAX::ADAG>

The abstract DAX aggregates instances of this class to be called when
the proper event is triggered on a workflow level.

=item L<Pegasus::DAX::Executable>

The executable class aggregates instances of this class to be called
when the proper event is triggered in a job that uses the executable.

=item L<Pegasus::DAX::Transformation>

The transformation class aggregates instances of this class to be called
when the proper event is triggered in a job that uses the transformation.
