=head1 NAME

Pegasus::DAX::PlainFilename - class for simple file names.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Pegasus::DAX::PlainFilename;

    my $i = Pegasus::DAX::PlainFilename->new( 'asdf.txt' );
    print "name is ", $i->name, "\n";
    $i->name = 'newname.txt';
    print "name is ", $i->name, "\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class remembers a simple filename. These filenames are aggregated
by the C<AbstractJob> class. A simple filename is either part of a
concrete job's argument list.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item new()

=item new( $filename )

=item new( name => $filename )

=item new( { name => $filename } )

The constructor may be called with a single scalar argument, which is
the filename string. Alternative ways to invoke the c'tor pass the
arguments as named list.

=item name()

This is the getter.

=item name( $name )

This is the setter.

=item toXML( $handle, $indent, $xmlns )

The purpose of the C<toXML> function is to recursively generate XML from
the internal data structures. The first argument is a file handle open
for writing. This is where the XML will be generated.  The second
argument is a string with the amount of white-space that should be used
to indent elements for pretty printing. The third argument may not be
defined. If defined, all element tags will be prefixed with this name
space.
