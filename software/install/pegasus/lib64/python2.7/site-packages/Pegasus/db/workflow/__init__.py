"""
Base classes that define the interface that the back-end specific
retrieval classes must expose.  Each read-only property includes
inline epydoc describing what is to be returned and what type
(string, int, an object) each property must return when called.

How a subclass caches attributes or performs lazy evaluation is
implementation-specific and not defined here.  The only conformity
necessary is that the proper property returns the correct data as
the correct type.

Any class attributes or methods that are specific to the subclass
implementations MUST start with an underscore:

ie: self._wf_uuid = None or def _calculateValue(self, job):

This signals that the attr or method is subclass-specific and
also allows the inherited __repr__() method to ignore it.
