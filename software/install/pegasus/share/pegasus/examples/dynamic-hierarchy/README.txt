This example highlights how you can have a hierarichal workflow where
the DAX for a dax job is generated by a parent dax generation
job. 

The outer level dax ( outer.dax ) has two dax jobs.

    - For the first DAX job , the DAX is created using the
    generate-dax job. It also shows how you can use different set of
    pegasus configuration files ( properties, rc, tc and sc ) for the
    DAX job. 

    - For the second DAX job, the DAX is already created and is
      tracked in the RC for the outer level workflow. The Pegasus
      configuration files are the same that are passed to the top
      level workflow. 


The DAX generation job is setup to run on a site called condorpool, that is a
local condor pool. The DAX job itself runs locally as it translates to
a condor dagman instance on the submit host. 

Note: For the example to run correctly the directory from where you run the 
example should be visible to the nodes making up your condor pool.
